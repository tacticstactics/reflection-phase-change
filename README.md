In optics, when tracking polarization, it is important how reflections change the polarization state. There are two ways to change the polarization: using a Faraday rotor and a 1/2 wave plate, but the purpose is to make the difference visually easier to understand.

Faraday Rotator:
Laterally polarized light is converted to vertically polarized light by passing through a 45° Faraday rotator twice through a reflective optical system.

Quarter Waveplate:
Laterally polarized light is converted to vertically polarized light by passing through a Quarter Waveplate twice through a reflective optical system.
Optical Axis is devitaed 45 degree from polarized light.
